abstract: Purifying selection is the most pervasive type of selection, as it constantly
  removes deleterious mutations arising in populations, directly scaling with population
  size. Highly expressed genes appear to accumulate fewer deleterious mutations between
  divergent species' lineages (known as E-R anticorrelation), pointing towards gene
  expression as an additional driver of purifying selection. However, estimates of
  the effect of gene expression on segregating deleterious variants in natural populations
  are scarce, as is an understanding of the relative contribution of population size
  and gene expression to purifying selection. Here, we analyse genomic and transcriptomic
  data from two natural populations of closely related sister species with different
  demographic histories, the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the King penguin
  (A. patagonicus), and show that purifying selection at the population-level depends
  on gene expression rate, resulting in very high selection coefficients at highly
  expressed genes. Leveraging realistic forward simulations, we estimate that the
  top 10% of the most highly expressed genes in a genome experience a selection pressure
  corresponding to an average selection coefficient of -0.1, which decreases to a
  selection coefficient of -0.01 for the top 50%. Gene expression rate can be regarded
  as a fundamental parameter of protein evolution in natural populations, maintaining
  selection effective even at small population size. We suggest it could be used as
  a proxy for gene selection coefficients, which are notoriously difficult to derive
  in non-model species under real-world conditions.
