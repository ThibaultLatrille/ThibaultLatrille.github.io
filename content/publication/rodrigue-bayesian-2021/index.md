abstract: In recent years, codon substitution models based on the mutation--selection
  principle have been extended for the purpose of detecting signatures of adaptive
  evolution in protein-coding genes. However, the approaches used to date have either
  focused on detecting global signals of adaptive regimes---across the entire gene---or
  on contexts where experimentally derived, site-specific amino acid fitness profiles
  are available. Here, we present a Bayesian site-heterogeneous mutation--selection
  framework for site-specific detection of adaptive substitution regimes given a protein-coding
  DNA alignment. We offer implementations, briefly present simulation results, and
  apply the approach on a few real data sets. Our analyses suggest that the new approach
  shows greater sensitivity than traditional methods. However, more study is required
  to assess the impact of potential model violations on the method, and gain a greater
  empirical sense its behavior on a broader range of real data sets. We propose an
  outline of such a research program.
