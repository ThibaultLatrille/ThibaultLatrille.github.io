  abstract = {While mammals are predominantly terrestrial, several lineages within them have independently transitioned to aquatic environments and exhibit a great variety of evolutionary changes, which ultimately lead to irreversible transitions to aquatic lifestyle. Such changes should also be detectable at the molecular level and, for instance, olfactory genes have been found to evolve under reduced selection and functionality in whales. However, the presence of a molecular signature related to aquatic transitions across other genes remains unknown as is the degree to which this affects only fully aquatic groups or also semiaquatic ones. Here, we use a Bayesian framework to investigate differences in the strength of purifying selection among terrestrial, semiaquatic and fully aquatic mammals using a set of 1000 orthologous genes, while accounting for shared ancestry, and controlling for body mass and effective population size. We found that selection relaxation linked to aquatic transitions is not only occurring in olfactory genes, but also detected across 20\% of the other genes analysed here. This consistent trend of genes under weaker selection is inferred in both semi- and fully aquatic mammals although the pattern is stronger in the latter. While most of the genes analysed here likely remain functional in all mammals, their evolution is inferred to be neutral in a substantial number of aquatic species, consistently with genes that might be losing their functionality. The inferred widespread relaxation of selection among genes is consistent with a macroevolutionary scenario where secondary transitions to aquatic environment eventually become irreversible.},

  abstract = {Evolution is, fundamentally, a tug-of-war around biological diversity in which two main types of opposing processes are involved. Diversity is generated by means of mutation, migration, and recombination; diversity is reduced by natural selection of fitter individuals over less-fit ones among a population. An additional component, known as genetic drift, is commonly acknowledged as the main random force in evolution. The diversity resulting from this tug-of-war can be observed at two different time and biological scales: between individuals of the same species at the population-genetic scale and between different species at the phylogenetic scale. The goal of this chapter is to formally describe the bridge between these two biological scales by defining diversity within each and by relating the underlying evolutionary processes between them. To this aim, we will describe the neutral and nearly neutral theories of evolution, setting the mathematical framework that will allow us to link the mutation rate at the population-genetic scale, which defines the amount of diversity present within a population, with the substitution rate, which defines the divergence between species at the phylogenetic scale. We here review how the neutral theory not only allows, conceptually, to establish a null model to study evolution but also actually sets clear connections between two sub-disciplines, namely population genetics and phylogenetics, which study manifestations of the same phenomena at different time scales. We discuss some consequences of bridging these time scales in current research in evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {To quantify selection acting on a trait, methods have been developed using either within or between-species variation. However, methods using within-species variation do not integrate the changes at the macro-evolutionary scale. Conversely, current methods using between-species variation usually discard within-species variation, thus not accounting for processes at the micro-evolutionary scale. The main goal of this study is to define a neutrality index for a quantitative trait, by combining within- and between-species variation. This neutrality index integrates nucleotide polymorphism and divergence for normalizing trait variation. As such, it does not require estimation of population size nor of time of speciation for normalization. Our index can be used to seek deviation from the null model of neutral evolution, and test for diversifying selection. Applied to brain mass and body mass at the mammalian scale, we show that brain mass is under diversifying selection. Finally, we show that our test is not sensitive to the assumption that population sizes, mutation rates and generation time are constant across the phylogeny, and automatically adjust for it.},

  abstract = {Mutations can be beneficial by bringing innovation to their bearer, allowing them to adapt to environmental change. These mutations are typically unpredictable since they respond to an unforeseen change in the environment. However, mutations can also be beneficial because they are simply restoring a state of higher fitness that was lost due to genetic drift in a stable environment. In contrast to adaptive mutations, these beneficial non-adaptive mutations can be predicted if the underlying fitness landscape is stable and known. The contribution of such non-adaptive mutations to molecular evolution has been widely neglected mainly because their detection is very challenging. We have here reconstructed protein-coding-gene fitness landscapes shared between mammals, using mutation-selection models and a multi-species alignments across 87 mammals. These fitness landscapes have allowed us to predict the fitness effect of polymorphisms found in 28 mammalian populations. Using methods that quantify selection at the population level, we have confirmed that beneficial non-adaptive mutations are indeed positively selected in extant populations. Our work confirms that deleterious substitutions are accumulating in mammals and are being reverted, generating a balance in which genomes are damaged and restored simultaneously at different loci. We observe that beneficial non-adaptive mutations represent between 15\% and 45\% of all beneficial mutations in 24 of 28 populations analyzed, suggesting that a substantial part of ongoing positive selection is not driven solely by adaptation to environmental change in mammals.},

  abstract = {Adaptation in protein-coding sequences can be detected from multiple sequence alignments across species or alternatively by leveraging polymorphism data within a population. Across species, quantification of the adaptive rate relies on phylogenetic codon models, classically formulated in terms of the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rates. Evidence of an accelerated nonsynonymous substitution rate is considered a signature of pervasive adaptation. However, because of the background of purifying selection, these models are potentially limited in their sensitivity. Recent developments have led to more sophisticated mutation-- selection codon models aimed at making a more detailed quantitative assessment of the interplay between mutation, purifying, and positive selection. In this study, we conducted a large-scale exome-wide analysis of placental mammals with mutation-- selection models, assessing their performance at detecting proteins and sites under adaptation. Importantly, mutation--selection codon models are based on a population- genetic formalism and thus are directly comparable to the McDonald and Kreitman test at the population level to quantify adaptation. Taking advantage of this relationship between phylogenetic and population genetics analyses, we integrated divergence and polymorphism data across the entire exome for 29 populations across 7 genera and showed that proteins and sites detected to be under adaptation at the phylogenetic scale are also under adaptation at the population-genetic scale. Altogether, our exome-wide analysis shows that phylogenetic mutation--selection codon models and the population- genetic test of adaptation can be reconciled and are congruent, paving the way for integrative models and analyses across individuals and populations.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic codon models are routinely used to characterize selective regimes in coding sequences. Their parametric design, however, is still a matter of debate, in particular concerning the question of how to account for differing nucleotide frequencies and substitution rates. This problem relates to the fact that nucleotide composition in protein-coding sequences is the result of the interactions between mutation and selection. In particular, because of the structure of the genetic code, the nucleotide composition differs between the three coding positions, with the third position showing a more extreme composition. Yet, phylogenetic codon models do not correctly capture this phenomenon and instead predict that the nucleotide composition should be the same for all three positions. Alternatively, some models allow for different nucleotide rates at the three positions, an approach conflating the effects of mutation and selection on nucleotide composition. In practice, it results in inaccurate estimation of the strength of selection. Conceptually, the problem comes from the fact that phylogenetic codon models do not correctly capture the fixation bias acting against the mutational pressure at the mutation--selection equilibrium. To address this problem and to more accurately identify mutation rates and selection strength, we present an improved codon modeling approach where the fixation rate is not seen as a scalar, but as a tensor. This approach gives an accurate representation of how mutation and selection oppose each other at equilibrium and yields a reliable estimate of the mutational process, while disentangling the mean fixation probabilities prevailing in different mutational directions.},

  abstract = {Mutation--selection phylogenetic codon models are grounded on population genetics first principles and represent a principled approach for investigating the intricate interplay between mutation, selection, and drift. In their current form, mutation--selection codon models are entirely characterized by the collection of site-specific amino-acid fitness profiles. However, thus far, they have relied on the assumption of a constant genetic drift, translating into a unique effective population size (Ne) across the phylogeny, clearly an unrealistic assumption. This assumption can be alleviated by introducing variation in Ne between lineages. In addition to Ne, the mutation rate ({$\mu$}) is susceptible to vary between lineages, and both should covary with life-history traits (LHTs). This suggests that the model should more globally account for the joint evolutionary process followed by all of these lineage-specific variables (Ne, {$\mu$}, and LHTs). In this direction, we introduce an extended mutation--selection model jointly reconstructing in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework the fitness landscape across sites and long-term trends in Ne, {$\mu$}, and LHTs along the phylogeny, from an alignment of DNA coding sequences and a matrix of observed LHTs in extant species. The model was tested against simulated data and applied to empirical data in mammals, isopods, and primates. The reconstructed history of Ne in these groups appears to correlate with LHTs or ecological variables in a way that suggests that the reconstruction is reasonable, at least in its global trends. On the other hand, the range of variation in Ne inferred across species is surprisingly narrow. This last point suggests that some of the assumptions of the model, in particular concerning the assumed absence of epistatic interactions between sites, are potentially problematic.},

  abstract = {Molecular evolution aims to characterize the mechanisms at work in the evolution of sequences, governed by a stochastic process whose main components are mutation, selection and genetic drift. In the long term, this stochastic process results in a history of substitution events along species trees, inducing complex patterns of molecular divergence between species. By analysing them, phylogenetic codon models aim at capturing the intrinsic parameters of evolution. In this context, this thesis has been focused on phylogenetic codon models, and on modelling the interplay between mutation, selection and drift shaping protein-coding DNA sequences. Because the composition of protein-coding DNA sequences does not reflect the underlying mutational process, but its filtering by selection at the level of amino acids, a careful modelling is necessary to tease apart mutation and selection. Therefore, I first developed a phylogenetic codon model of inference in which different rates of evolution give an accurate representation of how mutation and selection oppose each other at equilibrium. Between the opposing forces of mutation and selection, the balance is arbitrated by genetic drift, which in turn is modulated by effective population size. As a consequence, variation of effective population size along of a phylogeny can theoretically be inferred from the trails of substitutions along the lineages. I thus developed a second model of inference, reconstructing altogether site-specific fitness landscape, long-term trends in effective population size and in the changes in the mutation rate along the phylogeny. This Bayesian framework was tested against simulated data and then applied to empirical data. Estimates of the variation of effective population size corresponds to the expected direction of correlation with life-history traits or ecological variables. However, the magnitude of inferred variation is narrower than expected based on independent estimates. In order to understand this narrow variation in the estimated effective population size, I finally developed a theoretical model describing how changes in both effective population size or expression level of protein translate into a change in substitution rate. This response of the change in substitution rate is obtained under the assumption that proteins are under directional selection to maximize their conformational stability, and related the molecular parameters of protein biophysics. Results of this work imply a weak response of the substitution rate to changes in expression level or effective population size, which are interchangeable. This thesis demonstrates that the assumptions made on the structure of the fitness landscape have a critical importance on the sensitivity of changes in substitution rates to changes in ecological or molecular variables. Conversely, empirical observations of the patterns of substitutions in response to changes in molecular or ecological variables inform us about the underlying structure of the fitness landscape. Being based on the mutation-selection balance and by explicitly integrating effective population size, this work also presents a conceptual framework allowing to relate phylogenetics and population genetics, of which certain unification paths are envisaged},

  abstract = {Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of selection relative to drift is determined by effective population size (Ne). Populations with high Ne are expected to undergo stronger purifying selection, and consequently to show a lower substitution rate for selected mutations relative to the substitution rate for neutral mutations ({$\omega$}). However, computational models based on biophysics of protein stability have suggested that {$\omega$} can also be independent of Ne. Together, the response of {$\omega$} to changes in Ne depends on the specific mapping from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in protein expression level has been found empirically to result in decrease of {$\omega$}, an observation predicted by theoretical models assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive a theoretical approximation for the response of {$\omega$} to changes in Ne and expression level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is generally valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions. We applied these results to protein undergoing selection for their conformational stability and corroborate out findings with simulations under more complex models. We predict a weak response of {$\omega$} to changes in either Ne or expression level, which are interchangeable. Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the conformational stability may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain the empirically observed variation in {$\omega$} across species. Other aspects of protein biophysics might be explored, such as protein--protein interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of {$\omega$} to changes in Ne.},

To explain these fast evolutionary dynamics, an intra-genomic Red Queen model has been proposed, based on the interplay between two antagonistic forces: biased gene conversion, mediated by double-strand breaks, resulting in hot-spot extinction, followed by positive selection favouring new PRDM9 alleles recognizing new sequence motifs. Thus far, however, this Red Queen model has not been formalized as a quantitative population-genetic model, fully accounting for the intricate interplay between biased gene conversion, mutation, selection, demography and genetic diversity at the PRDM9 locus. Here, we explore the population genetics of the Red Queen model of recombination. A Wright-Fisher simulator was implemented, allowing exploration of the behaviour of the model (mean equilibrium recombination rate, diversity at the PRDM9 locus or turnover rate) as a function of the parameters (effective population size, mutation and erosion rates). In a second step, analytical results based on self-consistent mean-field approximations were derived, reproducing the scaling relations observed in the simulations. Empirical fit of the model to current data from the mouse suggests both a high mutation rate at PRDM9 and strong biased gene conversion on its targets.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

  abstract = {Models have always been central to inferring molecular evolution and to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitutions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or even tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we coupled stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep-learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matched that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference when rate heterogeneity followed a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeded it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we showed on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also showed that the integration of per-site rates obtained by deep learning within a Bayesian framework led to significantly more accurate phylogenetic inference, particularly with respect to the estimated branch lengths. We thus propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessment of statistical support.},

  abstract = {Purifying selection is the most pervasive type of selection, as it constantly removes deleterious mutations arising in populations, directly scaling with population size. Highly expressed genes appear to accumulate fewer deleterious mutations between divergent species' lineages (known as E-R anticorrelation), pointing towards gene expression as an additional driver of purifying selection. However, estimates of the effect of gene expression on segregating deleterious variants in natural populations are scarce, as is an understanding of the relative contribution of population size and gene expression to purifying selection. Here, we analyse genomic and transcriptomic data from two natural populations of closely related sister species with different demographic histories, the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the King penguin (A. patagonicus), and show that purifying selection at the population-level depends on gene expression rate, resulting in very high selection coefficients at highly expressed genes. Leveraging realistic forward simulations, we estimate that the top 10\% of the most highly expressed genes in a genome experience a selection pressure corresponding to an average selection coefficient of -0.1, which decreases to a selection coefficient of -0.01 for the top 50\%. Gene expression rate can be regarded as a fundamental parameter of protein evolution in natural populations, maintaining selection effective even at small population size. We suggest it could be used as a proxy for gene selection coefficients, which are notoriously difficult to derive in non-model species under real-world conditions.},
