abstract: Adaptation in protein-coding sequences can be detected from multiple sequence
  alignments across species or alternatively by leveraging polymorphism data within
  a population. Across species, quantification of the adaptive rate relies on phylogenetic
  codon models, classically formulated in terms of the ratio of nonsynonymous over
  synonymous substitution rates. Evidence of an accelerated nonsynonymous substitution
  rate is considered a signature of pervasive adaptation. However, because of the
  background of purifying selection, these models are potentially limited in their
  sensitivity. Recent developments have led to more sophisticated mutation-- selection
  codon models aimed at making a more detailed quantitative assessment of the interplay
  between mutation, purifying, and positive selection. In this study, we conducted
  a large-scale exome-wide analysis of placental mammals with mutation-- selection
  models, assessing their performance at detecting proteins and sites under adaptation.
  Importantly, mutation--selection codon models are based on a population- genetic
  formalism and thus are directly comparable to the McDonald and Kreitman test at
  the population level to quantify adaptation. Taking advantage of this relationship
  between phylogenetic and population genetics analyses, we integrated divergence
  and polymorphism data across the entire exome for 29 populations across 7 genera
  and showed that proteins and sites detected to be under adaptation at the phylogenetic
  scale are also under adaptation at the population-genetic scale. Altogether, our
  exome-wide analysis shows that phylogenetic mutation--selection codon models and
  the population- genetic test of adaptation can be reconciled and are congruent,
  paving the way for integrative models and analyses across individuals and populations.
