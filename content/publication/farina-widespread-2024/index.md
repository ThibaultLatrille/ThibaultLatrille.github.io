abstract: While mammals are predominantly terrestrial, several lineages within them
  have independently transitioned to aquatic environments and exhibit a great variety
  of evolutionary changes, which ultimately lead to irreversible transitions to aquatic
  lifestyle. Such changes should also be detectable at the molecular level and, for
  instance, olfactory genes have been found to evolve under reduced selection and
  functionality in whales. However, the presence of a molecular signature related
  to aquatic transitions across other genes remains unknown as is the degree to which
  this affects only fully aquatic groups or also semiaquatic ones. Here, we use a
  Bayesian framework to investigate differences in the strength of purifying selection
  among terrestrial, semiaquatic and fully aquatic mammals using a set of 1000 orthologous
  genes, while accounting for shared ancestry, and controlling for body mass and effective
  population size. We found that selection relaxation linked to aquatic transitions
  is not only occurring in olfactory genes, but also detected across 20% of the other
  genes analysed here. This consistent trend of genes under weaker selection is inferred
  in both semi- and fully aquatic mammals although the pattern is stronger in the
  latter. While most of the genes analysed here likely remain functional in all mammals,
  their evolution is inferred to be neutral in a substantial number of aquatic species,
  consistently with genes that might be losing their functionality. The inferred widespread
  relaxation of selection among genes is consistent with a macroevolutionary scenario
  where secondary transitions to aquatic environment eventually become irreversible.
