abstract: Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of selection
  relative to drift is determined by effective population size ($N_e$). Populations with
  high $N_e$ are expected to undergo stronger purifying selection, and consequently to
  show a lower substitution rate for selected mutations relative to the substitution
  rate for neutral mutations (ω). However, computational models based on biophysics
  of protein stability have suggested that ω can also be independent of $N_e$.
  Together, the response of ω to changes in $N_e$ depends on the specific mapping
  from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in protein expression level has
  been found empirically to result in decrease of ω, an observation predicted
  by theoretical models assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive
  a theoretical approximation for the response of ω to changes in $N_e$ and expression
  level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is generally
  valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions. We applied these results
  to protein undergoing selection for their conformational stability and corroborate
  out findings with simulations under more complex models. We predict a weak response
  of ω to changes in either $N_e$ or expression level, which are interchangeable.
  Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the conformational stability
  may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain the empirically observed variation
  in ω across species. Other aspects of protein biophysics might be explored,
  such as protein--protein interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of
  ω to changes in $N_e$.
