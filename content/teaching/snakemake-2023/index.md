The workshop "Introduction to Snakemake for reproducible research" is a half-day workshop aimed at introducing participants to the Snakemake workflow management system.
The workshop is designed for researchers who are interested in automating their data analysis workflows, and who have little to no experience with Snakemake.
The [workshop repository]('https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/workshop-snakemake-unil2023') contains all the material required to follow the workshop.
All the exercises and material required to complete them are available on the repository's [wiki]('https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/workshop-snakemake-unil2023/wiki/Exercises---Series').
