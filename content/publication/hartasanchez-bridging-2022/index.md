abstract: 'Evolution is, fundamentally, a tug-of-war around biological diversity in
  which two main types of opposing processes are involved. Diversity is generated
  by means of mutation, migration, and recombination; diversity is reduced by natural
  selection of fitter individuals over less-fit ones among a population. An additional
  component, known as genetic drift, is commonly acknowledged as the main random force
  in evolution. The diversity resulting from this tug-of-war can be observed at two
  different time and biological scales: between individuals of the same species at
  the population-genetic scale and between different species at the phylogenetic scale.
  The goal of this chapter is to formally describe the bridge between these two biological
  scales by defining diversity within each and by relating the underlying evolutionary
  processes between them. To this aim, we will describe the neutral and nearly neutral
  theories of evolution, setting the mathematical framework that will allow us to
  link the mutation rate at the population-genetic scale, which defines the amount
  of diversity present within a population, with the substitution rate, which defines
  the divergence between species at the phylogenetic scale. We here review how the
  neutral theory not only allows, conceptually, to establish a null model to study
  evolution but also actually sets clear connections between two sub-disciplines,
  namely population genetics and phylogenetics, which study manifestations of the
  same phenomena at different time scales. We discuss some consequences of bridging
  these time scales in current research in evolutionary biology.'
