abstract: "In humans and many other species, recombination events cluster in narrow
  and short-lived hot spots distributed across the genome, whose location is determined
  by the Zn-finger protein PRDM9. To explain these fast evolutionary dynamics, an
  intra-genomic Red Queen model has been proposed, based on the interplay between
  two antagonistic forces: biased gene conversion, mediated by double-strand breaks,
  resulting in hot-spot extinction, followed by positive selection favouring new PRDM9
  alleles recognizing new sequence motifs. Thus far, however, this Red Queen model
  has not been formalized as a quantitative population-genetic model, fully accounting
  for the intricate interplay between biased gene conversion, mutation, selection,
  demography and genetic diversity at the PRDM9 locus. Here, we explore the population
  genetics of the Red Queen model of recombination. A Wright-Fisher simulator was
  implemented, allowing exploration of the behaviour of the model (mean equilibrium
  recombination rate, diversity at the PRDM9 locus or turnover rate) as a function
  of the parameters (effective population size, mutation and erosion rates). In a
  second step, analytical results based on self-consistent mean-field approximations
  were derived, reproducing the scaling relations observed in the simulations. Empirical
  fit of the model to current data from the mouse suggests both a high mutation rate
  at PRDM9 and strong biased gene conversion on its targets.This article is part of
  the themed issue 'Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation
  in sexual organisms'."
