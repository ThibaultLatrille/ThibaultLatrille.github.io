abstract: Mutations can be beneficial by bringing innovation to their bearer, allowing
  them to adapt to environmental change. These mutations are typically unpredictable
  since they respond to an unforeseen change in the environment. However, mutations
  can also be beneficial because they are simply restoring a state of higher fitness
  that was lost due to genetic drift in a stable environment. In contrast to adaptive
  mutations, these beneficial non-adaptive mutations can be predicted if the underlying
  fitness landscape is stable and known. The contribution of such non-adaptive mutations
  to molecular evolution has been widely neglected mainly because their detection
  is very challenging. We have here reconstructed protein-coding-gene fitness landscapes
  shared between mammals, using mutation-selection models and a multi-species alignments
  across 87 mammals. These fitness landscapes have allowed us to predict the fitness
  effect of polymorphisms found in 28 mammalian populations. Using methods that quantify
  selection at the population level, we have confirmed that beneficial non-adaptive
  mutations are indeed positively selected in extant populations. Our work confirms
  that deleterious substitutions are accumulating in mammals and are being reverted,
  generating a balance in which genomes are damaged and restored simultaneously at
  different loci. We observe that beneficial non-adaptive mutations represent between
  15% and 45% of all beneficial mutations in 24 of 28 populations analyzed, suggesting
  that a substantial part of ongoing positive selection is not driven solely by adaptation
  to environmental change in mammals. Significance statement The extent to which adaptation
  to changing environments is shaping genomes is a central question in molecular evolution.
  To quantify the rate of adaptation, population geneticists have typically used signatures
  of positive selection. However, mutations restoring an ancestral state of higher
  fitness lost by genetic drift are also positively selected, but they do not respond
  to a change in the environment. In this study, we have managed to distinguish beneficial
  mutations that are due to changing environments and those that are restoring pre-existing
  functions in mammals. We show that a substantial proportion of beneficial mutations
  cannot be interpreted as adaptive.
