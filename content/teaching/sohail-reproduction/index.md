This practical work was given to Master students in biology at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon in 2017-2019 (3 years).
Reproducing (at least trying to) the study of [Sohail _et al_, Science (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah523874) on negative selection in humans and fruit flies.
The documentations and slides are available [here](/teaching/sohail-reproduction/TP-NGS-Polymorphism-Documentation.pdf) and [here](/teaching/sohail-reproduction/TP-NGS-Polymorphism-Slides.pdf) respectively.
The code and data are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/tp-polymorphism).
The results of the study is available [here](teaching/sohail-reproduction/TP-NGS-Polymorphism-Results.pdf).
